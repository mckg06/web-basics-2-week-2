        <div class="question-label">Question 1: Write a function that asks the user for two numbers and return the product of them. The challenge here is that you can't use the operator * (you can't make the product) </div>
        <div id="a-1"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="question-item">
        <div class="question-label">Question 2: Write a function that recieves a string as a parameter and evaluate each character of the string to determinate if the character is a vowel or a consonant. You have to store each character in separate arrays, one for vowels and the other one for consonants. After separating the characters concatenate both arrays. Ask the user if they want the vowels first or consonants first in the final array.</div>

        <div class="question-label">Question 3: Let's create a small game. The user should create a player (ask the user for a name).The player has 3 oportunities to guess a number. The number is a random number between 10 - 50. If the player doesn't guess the number, the program must display an alert and stop the game, but if the player guesses the number, then the program must show a congratulations message (alert) with the name of the player in upperCase letters and ends the game. You must store the player information in a 'player' object. Check the object specifications on index.js</div>

      <div class="question">
        <div class="question-label">Question 4: We are giving you an array of objects (check the index.js file) each one with the same properties. Give the user 3 different options to choose from which will sort the array from the highest to lowest. For properties that are strings, the criteria to sort is the length of the string. The first option of sorting the array is based on the title property. The second is sorting the array based on the author property, the third one is based on the library property. Finally, the return value has to be the string sorted by the property selected and separated with a semicolon.  Example: if the user selects to sort the array by title the output should be: <br>
        Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games; The Road Ahead; Walter Isaacson
